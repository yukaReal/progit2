= Pro Git, Second Edition

Welcome to the second edition of the Pro Git book.

You can find this book online at: http://git-scm.com/book

Like the first edition, the second edition of Pro Git is open source under a Creative Commons license.

A couple of things have changed since open sourcing the first edition.
For one, we've moved from Markdown to the amazing Asciidoc format for the text of the book.

We've also moved to keeping the translations in separate repositories rather than subdirectories of the English repository.
See link:CONTRIBUTING.md[the Contributing document] for more information.

== How To Generate the Book

You can generate the e-book files manually with Asciidoctor.
If you run the following you _may_ actually get HTML, Epub, Mobi and PDF output files:

----
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
Converting to HTML...
 -- HTML output at progit.html
Converting to EPub...
 -- Epub output at progit.epub
Converting to Mobi (kf8)...
 -- Mobi output at progit.mobi
Converting to PDF...
 -- PDF output at progit.pdf
----

An alternative to calling the `bundle` command is to call directly the `asciidoctor` command.
If it is the first time you're building the book, it is necessary to create the _images_ folder and fill it.
Do the following only once:

----
$ mkdir images/
$ cp book/*/images/* images/
----

Then you can build the book.
Use the following commands:

----
$ asciidoctor-pdf progit.asc
$ asciidoctor-epub3 progit.asc
$ asciidoctor-epub3 -a ebook-format=kf8 progit.asc
----

Both use the `asciidoctor`, `asciidoctor-pdf` and `asciidoctor-epub` projects.
